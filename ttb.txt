You’re natural state is enlightenment. Everything else you’ve ever been told
about yourself is a lie.
We’re trying to wake ourselves up, because we come from source energy, and we
are all one.
We have to realize that our brothers and sisters that we’re seeing in the
dream are mere reflections of our inner self.
Ying and yang. Love and hate.
People that we dislike are mere reflections of our own character defects.
People that we like and love are true successful manifestations of our
deepest, most inner self.
We are beings of light!
Our mission, is to be creation, and create positive energy on spaceship Earth.
